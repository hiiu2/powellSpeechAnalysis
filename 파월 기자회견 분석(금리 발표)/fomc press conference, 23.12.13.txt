thank you Chris rugaber at uh Associated Press I wanted to ask how should we
interpret the addition of the word any uh before additional firming in the statement I mean does that mean that
you're pretty much done with rate hikes and the committee has shifted away from a tightening bias and to a more neutral
stance thank you
so um specifically on on any um we do say that in determining the extent of
any additional policy firming that may be appropriate so any additional policy firming that sentence so we added the
word any as an acknowledgement that we believe that we are likely at or near the uh the peak rate for this cycle um
participants didn't write down additional hikes that we believe are likely uh so uh that's what we wrote
down um but participants also uh didn't want to take the possibility of further
hikes off the table so that's really what we were
thinking chairman um oh the microphone sorry uh Steve Leeman CNBC happy
holidays Mr chairman um fed Governor Chris Waller said that if inflation continues to fall then the FED uh in the
next several months could be cutting interest rates I wonder if you could comment on whether you agree with uh fed
Governor Waller on that that the FED would become more restrictive if it didn't cut rates of inflation fell thank
you sir so of course I I don't comment on uh on any other officials even those who
who were at the FED um so but I but I'll I'll try to answer your your question more broadly um so the way the way we're
looking at it is is really this uh when we when we started out right we said uh
the first question is how fast to move and we moved very fast the second question uh is um you know really uh how
high to raise the policy rate and that's really the question that we're still on here uh we're we're very focused on that
as I as I mentioned U people generally think that we're at or near that uh and
and think it's not likely that we will will hike although they don't take that possibility off the table so that's when
when you get to that question and that's your answer uh there's a natural naturally it begins to be the next
question which is when it will become appropriate to begin dialing back the amount of policy restraint that's in
place so that's really the next question and that's what people are thinking about and and and talking about and I I
would just say this um we are seeing uh you know strong growth that is that is
appears to be moderating we're seeing a labor market that is coming back into balance by so many measures and we're
seeing inflation making real progress these are the things we've been wanting to see we can't know uh we still have a
ways to go no one is declaring victory that would be premature and we can't be guaranteed of this progress so we're
we're moving carefully and making that assessment of whether we need to do more or not um and
uh that that's really the question that we're on but of course this the other question the question of when will it be
become appropriate to begin dialing back the amount of policy restraint in place that that begins to come into view uh
and is clearly a discuss topic of discussion out in the world and and also a discussion for us uh at our meeting
today can you give some color as to the nature of that discussion today thank you sure so it it it comes up in this
way today um Everybody wrote down an SCP forecast so many people mentioned what
their what their rate forecast was uh and uh there was no was no back and
forth no attempt to sort of reach agreement like this is what I wrote down this is what I think that kind of thing
uh and preliminary kind of a discussion like that not everybody did that but many people did and then and I would say
there's a general expectation that this will be this will be a topic for us looking ahead that that's really what
happened in today's meeting I can't do the headcount for you in real time but that's generally what happened today let
go to Rachel hi chair Powell Rachel seagull
from The Washington Post thanks for taking our questions at this point can you confidently say that the economy has
avoided a recession and isn't heading for one now and if the answer is no I'm curious about what you'd still be
looking for I I think you can say that there's
little basis for thinking that the economy is in a recession now um I would say that
I think there's there's always a probability uh that that there will be a recession in the next year and it's a
meaningful Pro probability no matter what the economy is doing so it's always a real possibility the question is is is
it so so it's a possibility here I have always felt since the beginning uh that
there was a possibility because of the unusual situation that the economy could
cool off uh in a way that enabled inflation to come down without the kind
of large job losses that have often been associated with high inflation and tightening Cycles so far that's what
we're seeing that's what many forecasters on and off the committee are seeing this result is not guaranteed it
is it is uh far too early to declare Victory um and there are certainly risks
it's certainly possible that that uh that the economy will behaven in un expected way it has done that repeatedly
through the post in the post-pandemic period nonetheless Where We Are is is we see the things that I that I
mentioned I'm curious if you're looking back on the past year you talked about navigating by the stars under Cloudy
Skies can you talk about some of the ways in which the economy surprised you most this year or you thought it would behave in one way and had to Pivot to
respond thanks so I think um forecasters generally if you go back
a year were very broadly forecasting a recession for this year for 2023
and not only did that not happen that includes fed forecasters and really essentially all forecasters a very high
proportion of forecasters were very weak growth or recession not only did that not happen we actually had a very strong
Year and that was a combination of of strong demand but also real gains on the
supply side so this was the year when labor force partic participation picked up where immigration picked up where the
um distortions to supply and demand from the pandemic you know the shortages and
and the bottlenecks Really began to unwind so we had significant supply side gains with strong demand and we got what
looks like a 2 and a half% plus or a little more than that growth year at a time when potential growth this year
might even have been higher than that just because of the the healing on the supply side so that was a surprise to
just about everybody I think the inflation forecast is roughly roughly what people wrote down a year ago but in
a very different setting and I would say the labor market because of the stronger growth has also been um significantly
better if you look back at the SCP from a year ago there was a significant increase in in unemployment it didn't
really happen we're still at 3.7% so we've seen um you know strong growth uh
still a tight labor market but one that's coming back into balance with the with support from the supply side a
greater supply of labor it's a you know that's that's what we see and that I think that combination was was not
anticipated broadly
Howard uh thanks Howard Schneider with uh reers and thanks for taking the questions I I wonder if you could uh
give a little more color detail on what what motivates the lower rates next year um whether it's a coincidence for
example that the spread between uh PC inflation core inflation and the federal
funds rate stays constant over the year are you simply calibrating against the fall in the in prices in the price level
uh that you're in the rate of inflation that you're expecting uh as opposed to supporting the
economy not nothing quite that mechanical is happening the the SCP really is is a Bottoms Up built from the
bottom up right so I think people are looking at what's happening in the economy and I think if you look at the
big difference from September in the SCP the expectations for inflation this year
both headline and core have come down you know really significantly in three months that's a big piece of of this at
the same time um growth is turned out to be very strong in the third quarter is slowing we believe as as appropriate and
we've got we've had several labor market reports which suggest again significant
progress toward greater balance across a very a broad range of indicators you're seeing the so many of the indicators
coming back to normal not all of them but so I think that people look at that and they write down their they basically
each individual writes down a forecast and a rate forecast that goes with that forecast we tabulate them and and public
it uh and so it's not it isn't you ask about um real rates I take it you know
that's that is that is something that we're very conscious of and aware of and and monitor and it's certainly a big
part of it's a part of how we think about things but really it's broader Financial conditions that matter and and
as you will know it's it's so hard to know exactly you know what the what the real rate is or exactly how tight policy
is at any given time so it you you couldn't follow that like it was a rule
and think that you would get the right answer all the time but it's certainly Something That We're focused on and indeed if you look at the projections I
think the expectation would be that the real rate is declining as we as we move forward it sounds like the discussion
over that I could follow up has has already kind of begun I'm wondering U just related to to Steve's question how
the how the tactics of this play out given the slowing of inflation and the fact that the deeper you get into 2024
the closer you get to a presidential election do you want to frontload this in other words yeah no we we're we don't
think about political events we don't think about politics we think about what's the right thing to do for the economy the minute we start thinking
about those things you know we just can't do that we have to think what's the right thing we'll do the things that we think are
right for the economy at the time we when we think is the right time that that's what we'll always do so I
mentioned we're moving carefully one of the things we're moving carefully about is that decision over that assessment
really over whether we've done enough really uh and you see that people are not riding down rate hikes that's that's
us thinking that we have done enough but not not feeling that really strongly confidently and not wanting to take the
possibility of a rate hike off the table nonetheless it's not the B base case anymore obviously as it was you know 60
90 days ago so that's that's how we're that's how we're approaching things and and you know as I mentioned um we wrote
down this sep and it talks about uh it people have individual assessments of
when it will be appropriate to um you know toh start to dial back on on the
tight policy we have in place and that's a discussion we'll be having going forward but uh that's another assessment
that we're going to make very carefully uh so as time goes
[Music] forward Nick timos of the Wall Street Journal chair poell you've argued over
the last year that policy tightening started before you actually lifted off because the market anticipated your
moves and tightened on your behalf the market is now easing policy on your behalf by anticipating a funds rate by
next September that's a full point below the current level with cuts beginning around March is this something that you
are broadly comfortable with um so this this last year has been
remarkable for the uh the sort of seesaw thing back and forth we've had over the
course of the year of markets moving away and moving back and that kind of thing so and what I would just say is is
that we we focus on what we have to do and how we need to use our tools to achieve our goals and that's what we
really focus on and people are going to have different forecasts about the economy and they're going to those are
going to show up in market conditions or or they won't you know but in any case we have to do what we think is right and
you know in in the long run it's important that Financial conditions become aligned or are aligned with what
we're trying to accomplish and in in the long run they will be of course because we will do what it takes to get to our
goals and ultimately that will mean that Financial conditions will will come along but in the meantime there can be
back and fourth and you know I I'm just focused on what's the right thing for us to do and my colleagues are focused on
that too the markets seem to think inflation is coming down credibly uh do
you believe we're at the point where inflation is coming down credibly I listen I I welcome the progress I
think it's it's um it's really good to see the progress that we're making uh I think if you look at the 12- month me
look at the six-month measures you see very low low numbers if you look at 12 month measures you're still well above
2% you're actually above 3% on core um through through November pce um but
isn't to say I I'm not you know calling into question the progress it's great we just need to see more we need to see you
know continued further further progress toward getting back to 2% that's that's what we need to see so um you know our
it's our job to restore price stability and that it's one of our two jobs along with maximum employment and they're
equal so we're very focused on on you know doing that as I mentioned we're
moving carefully at this point um we're pleased with the progress but uh but we
see the need for for further progress and I think I think it's it's fair to
say uh there is a lot of uncertainty about going forward we seen the economy move in surprising Direction so we're
just going to need to see more further progress
Gina Gina smik New York Times thanks for taking our questions um in the SCP from
today growth is notably below potential in 2024 if growth were to surprise us again in the way that it has for years
now by being stronger than expected next year would it still be possible to cut rates or put another way is below Trend
growth necessary to cut rates or would continued progress on inflation alone be sufficient so we'll we'll look at the
totality of the data growth is one thing um uh so is inflation so is labor market
data so we we look at the tot as we as we make decisions about policy Chang is going forward we're look at all those
things and particularly about the as they affect the Outlook it's all it's ultimately all about the Outlook and the
balance of risks as well so that's that's what we'd be looking for um if we have stronger growth you know that'll be
good for people though that'll be good for the labor market it might actually mean that it takes a little longer to get inflation down to 2% we will get it
down to 2% but um you know if if we see stronger growth we we'll we will set
policy according to what we actually see and and so that's how I would answer I
guess the qu I guess the question I'm asking if you don't mind a quick followup I guess the question I'm asking is is above Trend growth itself a
problem it's only a problem and so it's not itself a problem it it's only in a problem in so far as it makes it more
difficult for us to achieve our goals um and if you know if you have if you have growth that's robust what that will mean
is probably will keep the labor market very strong it probably will will place some upward pressure on inflation that
could mean that it takes longer to get to 2% inflation that could mean we need to keep rates higher for longer it could
even mean ultimately that we would need to hike again um it just is that's the way the way our policy
Works Neil hi chair pal Neil Irwin with axios
um how do you interpret the state of the labor market right now and in particular you've referred even today to evidence
that it's coming into better balance uh what would you need to see to conclude that it has reached that balance so on on the better balance side
just a lot of things it's um you see you see job growth um still strong but
moving back down to more sustainable levels given population growth and labor force participation um the things that are not
quite but let me go on with that list uh you know claims are low if you look at surveys of businesses that they're
they're sort of the era of uh this frantic labor shortage are behind us and
they're seeing a shortage of Labor is being significantly alleviated if you look at at shortages of workers um
whereas they thought job ability job job availability was the highest that had ever been or close to it that's downed
down to more normal levels by so many measures participation unemployment so many measures the Unemployment uh job
openings uh uh quits all of those things so wages are still running a bit above
what would be consistent with 2% inflation over a long period of time they've been gradually cooling off but
if wages are running around 4% that's still a bit above I would say
um and I guess there they're just a couple of other uh the unemployment rate is is very very low um and these are but
but I would just say overall the development of the labor market has been very positive it's been a good time to
for workers to find jobs and get solid wage increases
Claire hi Jones Financial Times um you know I'd say the mood among economists
at the moment seems to be one of cautious optimism which is somewhat corroborated by your forecast by this
sense that we all going to have a soft Landing yeah then we when we hear from
the general public there's a lot of Discord about economic conditions what do you think explains this disconnect
and does it matter for policy makers um it may be a common the theme
is that well inflation is coming down and that's very good news
the price level is not coming down prices of some some goods and services are coming down but overall in in the
aggregate the price level is not good so people are still living with high prices and uh that's that's not that is
something that people don't like and you know what's what will happen with that
is wages are now um real wages are now positive so that wages are now moving up
more than inflation as inflation comes down and so that uh that might help uh
improve the mood of people but we do see those we see those um public opinion surveys the thing that we can do is to
do our jobs which is to use our tools to Foster price stability which has such
great benefits over such long periods of time and which is the thing that really enables us to work for and Achieve uh an
extended period of high employment which is so beneficial for you know families and and companies around the
country [Music] Victoria um hi Victoria Guido with
Politico I wanted to ask um you know on on the flip side of if things start to
deteriorate rapidly if we do fall into a recession if we do start to see unemployment rise at sort of the levels
of inflation that we're seeing now how would you all think about that in terms of rate Cuts would that be a sign that
you've you've done your job demand wise sorry if if if the economy uh
starts to looks like it's starting to fall into recession if if the jobless rate starts to
rise that's not something we're hoping to see obviously we're hoping to to see
something very different which is continuation of what we have seen which is uh the labor market coming into
better balance without a significant increase in unemployment inflation coming down without a significant
increase in unemployment and growth moderating without a significant increase in unemployment that that's what we're we're trying very much to
achieve and uh not something we're looking to see but but would you take that as a signal that you should cut
rates I you know I obviously what we'll do is we'll look at the totality of the
data as I've mentioned a couple times and certainly the labor data would be important in that and you know you if
you you can you can describe a situation like that were if if there were the beginning of a recession or something
like that then yes that would certainly weigh heavily in that decision
Michael M Michael mcke from Bloomberg television radio uh Mr chairman you were by your
own admission behind the curve in starting to raise rates to fight inflation and you said earlier again the
full effects of our tightening cycle have not yet been felt uh how will you decide when to cut rates and how will
you ensure you're not behind the curve
there so we're we're we're aware of the risk
that we would uh hang on too long you know we we know that that's a risk and
we're very focused on not making that mistake and uh we do regard the two you
know we've come back into a better balance between the risk of overdoing it and the risk of underdoing it not only
that we were able to focus hard on the on the price stability mandate and we're
getting back to the point where which is what you do when you're very far from from one of them one of the two mandates
you're getting now back to the point where both mandates are are important and they're they're more in Balance too so I think we'll be we'll be very much
keeping that in mind as as we make policy going forward and the things we'll be looking at I've already describ
you know we're we're obviously looking hard at at what's happening with demand
and what we see we see the same thing other people see which is a strong economy which really put up quite a
performance in 2023 we see good evidence and good reason to believe that growth
will come in lower next year and you see what the forecasts are I think the median growth median participant wrote
down 1.4% growth but you know we'll have to see it's very hard to predict um
we'll also be looking to see progress on inflation and and you know the labor market remaining strong but but ideally
with without seeing the kind of large increase in unemployment that happens
sometimes a follow up uh when you begin The Cutting cycle will it be essentially
run the same way you do it now with uh raising rates where you uh basically do trial and error cut and see what happens
or will you tie it to some particular measure of
progress we haven't typically tried to articulate uh with one exception a really specific Target levels which was
if you some of you will remember the thresholds that we used in I guess 2013 I don't the answer is um these are
things that we have that we haven't you know really worked out yet um we're sort of just at the beginning of of that
discussion Edward thank you Mr chairman uh Edward Lawrence of the fox business so um If
the Fed Cuts rates as the Dot Plot is is showing about 75 basis points does that signal or that there's a belief of
weakness next year in the economy it wouldn't if if that were
first of all that let me just say that isn't a plan that's that's just accumulating what people wrote down so that's not something you know this but
allow me to say it again we don't debate or discuss what the right you know whose
sep is right we just say what they are and we tabulate them and polish them so and it's you know it's important for people to know that but um it it
wouldn't need to be a sign of it could just be a sign that the econom is normalizing and it doesn't need the the
tight policy it depends on the economy can evolve in many different ways right so um but but it could be more what I
just described and you focused on core inflation we've heard from in other meetings um how sticky is core inflation
right now well that's what we're finding out and we've you know we've seen real
progress in in core inflation it has been sticking and famously the service sector is is thought to be stickier but
we've actually seen reasonable progress in non-housing Services uh which was the area where where you would expect to see
less progress we are seeing some progress there though in fact all three of the categories of core are now
contributing Goods Housing Services non-housing Services they're all contributing in different at different
levels you know meeting by meeting or rather report by report so yeah let's go
to Karina Katarina Sara Bloomberg News um
thanks for taking our questions um I just wanted to ask a little bit about um
you know we had some pretty uh positive data this you know this morning and yesterday
um I'm assuming those were not incorporated into the forecasts we see today um but I just wanted to ask you
know how that kind of adds um to your thinking um you know on the inflation
Outlook all right so we got we got CPI the morning of the first day and we got
PPI the next day which informs the you know the trans translation in into pce
so it's very very late in the game you know to to but nonetheless um
participants are allowed to encourage to update their sep forecasts until
probably midm morning today after that it's so staff has to has to accumulate all of that and create the the the
documents that you see so until about midm morning A little maybe later late morning uh it's okay to update and I
believe some people did update their forecasts based on what we saw today okay and you see I mean how are
you when you think about you know starting to think about about the rate Cuts next year or whenever they come um
how do you you know how do you think about the economy we're in now kind of post-pandemic do you think that there's
been significant structural shifts and is that going to change how you look at a rate cut
path the question of whether there have been fundamental structural shifts is is a really hard to know the answer and a
very interesting one right now the the one that would affect one that comes to mind though is
just the question of where the neutral rate of interest is and so for example if it's risen and and I'm not saying
that it has but if it were to have risen that would mean that that that interest rates would need to be a little bit
higher to convey the same level of restriction the thing is we're not really going to know that you know
people will be writing papers about that 10 years from now and still fighting about it so it's just that it's going to
be uncertain so we're going to be making policy in this you know difficult uncertain really unprecedented
environment um some someone once said that you know the you know the natural rate of
interest by its works and that's really right but that's very difficult because policy operates with a lag so it's one
of the reasons why we slowed down this year we started slowing down at this meeting last year uh reducing the pace
at which we were adding uh restriction and uh over the course of this year we really slowed down a lot to give those
lags time to work in terms of demand has demand shifted more away from Services
into Goods there's you can make a case for that that the the shift back into
Services has not been complete and it doesn't look like it's ongoing but I don't know if that's right maybe people
just bought so much stuff that they temporarily don't want any more stuff they haven't got any place to put
it go to Jennifer thank you chair pal Jennifer
sha Berger with Yahoo finance you said back in July that you needed to start cutting rates before getting to 2%
inflation as you mentioned pce inflation is now running at 3 and a half on core on a
six-month annual basis core pce is running at 2 and a half% though when you look at Super core and shelter they are
of course stickier so when looking in the different components of the data how much closer do you have to get to 2%
before you consider cutting rates I mean the reason you wouldn't
wait to get the 2% to cut rates is that policy would be it would be
too late I mean you you'd want to be reducing restriction on the economy
well before 2% because before or before you get to 2% so you don't overshoot if
we think think of restrictive policy as Weighing on economic activity um you
know it takes it takes a while for policy to get into the economy affect economic activity and affect inflation
so I I can't give you a precise answer but if you look at what's in the in the
SCP and you know I think you'll see a reasonable estimate of the time lags and things like that that it would take you
think 3% would be reasonable I wouldn't want to I wouldn't want to identify any one precise uh
point because I I would be able to look back then and probably find out that it turned out not to be right but we'll be
looking at it and and uh looking at the broad collection of
factors hi chair P Gan young with market news um wanted to go back to the stickiness of
inflation question um over the past couple of years a lot of central Bankers have talked about the more difficult
Last Mile of getting inflation back down to 2% yet it's also been surprising how
fast inflation has come down this year um I'm curious do you think something has changed in our understanding of
inflation um or do you subscribe to this notion still or is it something different about the US economy thank you
I I think um I I think this you know we we felt
since the beginning that it would be a combination of two factors the first factor is just the unwinding of of what
happened in the pandemic the distortions to supply and demand and the second thing would be our policy which was
weighing on aggregate demand and actually making it easier for the supply side to recover because of lower demand we thought those two things were going
to be necessary sorry say your say the last part of your question again if there was something different
about the US economy yeah so it's it's not that it may or may not be about different the US economy being different
I think that this inflation was not the classic demand
overload pot boiling over kind of inflation that we think about it was a combination of very strong demand
without question and unusual supply side restrictions both on the good side but also on the labor side because we had a
we had a participation shock so this is just very unusual and you know we had the view my colleagues and I broadly had
the view that we could get a lot of you know we had essentially a vertical supply curve because you you ran into
the limits of of capacity at very low levels because there weren't workers and because people couldn't the the supply
chains were all broken so we we had the view that you could come straight down that vertical supply curve to the extent
demand lowered reduced and you know something like that has happened it
happened so far the question is you know it once once that part of it runs out
and we think it has a ways to run we definitely think that the that the um uh the sort of supply chain and shortages
side has some some ways to run does labor force participation have much more
to run it might immigration could help but it may be that at some point you at some point you will run out of supply
side help and then it gets down to demand and it gets harder that that's very possible but to say with certainty
that the last mile is going to be different I I'm be reluctant to you know to to suggest that we have any certainty
around that we just don't know I mean inflation keeps coming down the labor market keeps getting back into balance
and INF you know it's um so far so good although we we we kind of assume that
that it will get harder from here but so far it hasn't we'll go to Megan for the last
question hi chair pal thanks for taking our questions Megan cassella with baren I
want to ask about the balance sheet given the fed's focus now on proceeding carefully and considering rate cuts and
um can you talk us through what the latest thinking is and has there been any consideration of altering the pace of quantitative tightening at
all we're um we're not talking about alter altering the pace of QT right now
um just to get that out of the way so balance sheet uh seems to be working
pretty much as expected um what we've been seeing is uh you know that we're
allowing runoff each month that's adding up I think we're down we're close to 1.2 trillion now that's showing up uh the um
reverse repo facility has been coming down quickly and reserves have been either moving up or as a result or
holding steady at a certain point uh you know there won't be any more to come out of or there'll be a level that where the
reverse repo facility um levels out and at that point reserves will start to
come down we you know we still have you know you know that we intend to
um reduce our Securities holders until we judge that the quantity of Reserve balances has reached a level somewhat
above that consistent with ample reserves um and and we also intend to
slow and then stop the decline in size of the balance sheet when Reserve B Es are somewhat above the level judged to
be consistent with ample reserves we're not at those levels we you know with with reserves close to three and a half
trillion um we're not we don't think we're at those reserves there isn't a lot of evidence of that we're watching it carefully and you know uh so so far
so far it's working pretty much as expected we think adjusting that thinking At All by
the time you're you're considering or moving forward with rate Cuts is that time to rethink or are you still going to follow um that thinking
um so I think they're they're on Independent tracks so you're you're asking though the question I guess
you're implying the question of can can you uh continue with
QT at at such time QT which is a tightening action at such time as uh
policy still tight and the answer is it depends on the reason you know if you're if you're uh if you're cutting rates
because you're going back to normal that's one thing if you're cutting them because the econom is really weak so I
you can imagine you have to know what the reason is to know whether it would be appropriate to do those two things at the same time thank you thanks very
much
